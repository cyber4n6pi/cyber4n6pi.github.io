### Books

**Blockchain Basics:  A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps**, *Daniel Drescher* (Apress)  
If you're new to Blockchain (i.e. infrastructure, terminology, function, use cases, etc.), this is THE perfect book to get you started in the right direction.  Lots of examples and analogies, organized and well-written.  
*Available in a variety of formats on Amazon.*

**The Code Book:  The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography**, *Simon Singh* (Anchor)  
Extremely well-written book on the history of cryptography, complete with side stories, insights, puzzles and humour.  If only all history books were written this well!  
*Available in a variety of formats on Amazon.*

I don't think he's the official "Godfather of Security" but he should be!!  He has books, blogs podcasts and some real-life interesting stories.
